Hello  youre here cool! consider following my twitter @Skullzy_ and ask any questions youd like my DMs are open!

A QQE MOD INSTRUCTIONS:
For now you can check out the first file A QQE MOD pinescript v4 indicator I made for trdingview.com from modding QQE.
Very simple to use just copy paste the code into tradingviews Pine editor, save and add to chart. 
Then you MUST set the candles to heikein ashi and you can check out the profitibality on your favorite crypto, stock
and even forex pairs! Works with most timeframes but 15Minutes to 4 hour seems the best. This will not work to set alerts and use webhooks. 
IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN THAT THEN KEEP READING. (FEEL FREE TO FORK WITH YOUR CHANGES!)

A QQE MOD heikein ashi convert INSTRUCTIONS:
For automated trading using the A QQE MOD to use for alerts and webooks firstly you must have tradingview.com pro for webhooks and Pro for more
then 1 alert on 1 account at a time. The reason the A QQE MOD doesnt work is because it needs to be set to heikein ashi but it isnt currently
possible to create alerts based on heikein ashi candle data, UNTIL NOW! try out my attempt at converting all the receiving data for QQE
to be coming from Heikein ashi candlestick data even though your on regular candlesticks. So now you can set an alert and attach a webhook while on regular
candles and get heikein ashi data. USE A QQE MOD heikein ashi convert. and set up your alerts. I currently am using bybit.com tradingview webhook alerts
built in feature which you can find in your bybit account settings! or you can use this pinescript indicator strategy using popular services that convert trading 
view alerts to trades using webooks! KNOWN ERROR/CURRENTLY THE STRATEGY DOESNT PLACE SHORT TRADES!! FEEL FREE TO FORK WITH YOUR CHANGES AND MAKE SHORTS WORK PROFITABLY!

REST OF FILES:
So most of the files in this repository are not functional some attempts at automating pinescripts by sending data to email instead of 
webhook url which so that we can fetch the trade data message info using json data in the alert message! but very hard and luck finishing it anytime soon.
and some earlier attempts at finishing the QQE MOD for now unless your a coder and want to fix FORK or analyze some of the methods Ive tried using python or earlier
pinescripts. JUST STICK TO THE FIRST TWO FILES AND ENJOY
